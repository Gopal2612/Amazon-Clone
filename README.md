This is a amazon-clone we app . 
Tech-used - reactjs, material ui ,firebase,javascript,react-router-dom.
This app has also sign in functionality . I have used firebase for the authentication and sign in sign up .
Also used material ui for icons and to give the good look to the ui
I have used context api for the state-management for add to cart and remove items from cart functionality.
